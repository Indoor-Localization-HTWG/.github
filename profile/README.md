# HTWG Indoor Localization Team Project

## Organization Repository
This repository serves as the central coordination point for the HTWG team project on indoor localization. It provides an overview of the overall project, defines goals, and links to the individual technology-specific repositories.

## Project Description
Our team at HTWG investigates methods for accurate indoor positioning using a remote-controlled car equipped with a Raspberry Pi. We focus on two complementary technologies:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy Angle of Departure (BLE AoD)**
- **Ultra-Wideband (UWB)**

Each technology is implemented and evaluated in its own repository to allow parallel development and clear separation of concerns.

## Goals
1. **Research & Implementation**  
   - Develop independent BLE AoD and UWB localization prototypes.
2. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Measure and compare accuracy, stability, and implementation effort of each method.
3. **Analysis & Comparison**  
   - Generate comparative reports summarizing strengths and limitations.
4. **Hybrid Approach (Optional)**  
   - Explore combining BLE AoD and UWB to enhance overall localization precision, if time and resources permit.
